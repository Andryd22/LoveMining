# LoveMining

## 📌 Project Overview

LoveMining is a platform designed to connect people based on compatibility. The main idea behind the project is to combine geographical proximity with shared interests to help users find the best possible match. The application focuses on creating a system where people can easily interact based on where they live and what they like to do.

The project consists in some different datasets: the core dataset contains approximately 60,000 profiles, occupying roughly [~55MB]. The interaction layer among users is split into likes.csv (~400,000 records, [20MB]) and dislikes.csv (~730,000 records, [35MB]), providing over 1.1 million graph edges. The reciprocity logic resulted in matches.csv, a file containing about 3,500 mutual connections and the reviews.csv file containing about the same number of reviews.

The project also exposes RESTful APIs that allows to interact with the system.
